//! Session lifecycle commands (`docs/MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` §9).
//!
//! Each command is a thin, named entry point onto Session Core — no logic
//! lives here beyond naming the operation. That is deliberate: the window and
//! the tray are meant to call the same Core APIs (§3), so a command must not
//! be able to do something the tray could not.
//!
//! Commands return the post-operation [`SessionRuntime`] so a caller has the
//! new state without waiting for the event it will also receive; a refusal or
//! a failure returns the structured [`SessionError`], which names the
//! operation and the reason (`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` §9).
//!
//! Tauri maps the frontend's camelCase arguments onto these snake_case
//! parameters, so the frontend calls `startSession({ sessionId })`.
