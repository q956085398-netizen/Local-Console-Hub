//! Logging commands (`docs/MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` §9).
//!
//! The read side of T05's logging core: what a session's policy is doing
//! (`get_log_info`), what it has run (`get_run_history`), and the two actions
//! a user can take on a live run — save it (`save_run_log`, the `on_error`
//! policy's "I want this one after all") and switch recording on or off
//! (`set_log_recording`, the `manual` policy).
//!
//! T10 adds the logs *view*'s four actions (`docs/LOGGING.md` §10): open the
//! log file, open the folder that holds it, and the two halves of retention —
//! what a sweep would remove (`preview_log_cleanup`) and the sweep itself
//! (`cleanup_logs`). Like the lifecycle commands, each names a single Core
//! operation and adds nothing to it, and none of them decides anything the
//! view could have decided for itself.
//!
//! ## Why opening a file is a command rather than a path argument
//!
//! `open_log_file` takes a session id and an optional run id, never a path.
//! Session Core resolves those to a file the session actually owns, so the
//! webview cannot ask the OS to open an arbitrary path — the command's shape is
//! what makes that impossible, not a check inside it
//! (`crate::shell`'s module note).
