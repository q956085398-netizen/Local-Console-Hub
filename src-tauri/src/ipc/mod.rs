//! IPC layer — Tauri commands, events and DTO mapping.
//!
//! This module is the explicit frontend/backend contract
//! (`MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` §9): commands are named and typed, there is
//! no generic "execute arbitrary backend action" command, and every session
//! event includes the session id.
//!
//! Current surface: the `ping` bootstrap command proving the typed invoke path
//! end to end (T00), startup config diagnostics, the session lifecycle and
//! service-action commands (T04, T08), the logging read/action commands (T05),
//! the terminal commands (T07), the logs view's file and retention commands
//! (T10) and the launch request a shortcut made (#63).

// `generate_handler!` resolves each command through hidden items the macro
// emits beside the function, so commands are registered by their own module
// path (`ipc::session::start_session`) rather than re-exported here.
