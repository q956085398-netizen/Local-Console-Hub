//! Session Core — the single source of lifecycle truth
//! (`docs/MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` §3, §5).
//!
//! Everything that wants to change what a session is doing goes through this
//! type: the window, the tray, and any future scheduler. It owns the registry,
//! decides transitions against [`super::state`], drives the T03 supervisor for
//! real runs, and publishes [`SessionEvent`]s to a sink.
//!
//! ## Why the sink is a trait
//!
//! Core publishes to an [`EventSink`] rather than to a Tauri `Emitter`. That
//! keeps the lifecycle runnable with no window at all — which is both what
//! makes it testable and what satisfies "session state is independent of
//! main-window visibility": hiding the window can only mean nothing is
//! listening, never that the state machine stops running.
//!
//! ## Locking
//!
//! One lock per session, held only for the duration of one operation on that
//! session. A `stop` blocks for as long as its stop timeout, and it must not
//! be able to hold up a different session's start or the tray summary, so the
//! registry lock is never held across a lifecycle operation. Events are
//! published after the session lock is released, so a sink can never deadlock
//! against the operation that produced it.
