//! Session lifecycle states and the transition table
//! (`docs/MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` §5).
//!
//! This is the one place that decides which lifecycle moves are legal. It is a
//! pure table over the status enum — no I/O, no clock, no process — so the
//! rules Session Core enforces can be read off the spec and tested directly.
//! Session Core asks the table and turns a `false` into a structured
//! rejection; nothing else is allowed to invent a transition.
