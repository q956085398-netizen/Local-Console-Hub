//! Rotation and retention (`docs/LOGGING.md` §9).
//!
//! Logs must not grow without limit, and cleanup must not be a single
//! indiscriminate sweep: §9 requires it per session, "so one high-output
//! service cannot push out every other session's logs". That is why the policy
//! is a **per-session** budget rather than a total one — a noisy session hits
//! its own ceiling and stops deleting anything of its own, and no other
//! session's history is touched.
//!
//! ## Planning is separate from deleting
//!
//! [`cleanup_plan`] is a pure function over a list of files; [`enforce`] is the
//! part that walks the disk and unlinks. Keeping them apart is what makes the
//! rule testable without a filesystem, and it is what lets a future UI show
//! "this will delete 12 files / 40 MB" before anything is removed
//! (`docs/LOGGING.md` §10 lists "clean old logs" as a UI action, and a
//! destructive action needs to be able to say what it will do first).
//!
//! ## What cleanup will not touch
//!
//! Only files under the Hub's own logs root, and only `*.log` under a
//! `<session>/<month>/` directory. An application-owned log linked with
//! `source: external` lives wherever the application put it, is not under this
//! root, and is never a candidate — spec §15 forbids deleting another
//! application's logs, and D-005 is the reason they were linked rather than
//! copied in the first place.
