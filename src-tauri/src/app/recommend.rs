//! Which display mode a launch method can be confirmed to need (#66, spec #59
//! decision 9).
//!
//! Some launch methods bring a console of their own: a `.bat` launcher runs
//! under `cmd.exe`, and a console-subsystem executable gets a console window
//! from Windows. Those are exactly the applications the standalone-window mode
//! exists for — embedding them in the Hub shows the user a Hub terminal with
//! nothing useful in it *and* the application's own console, which is the
//! duplication spec #59's problem statement describes.
//!
//! ## What this is allowed to decide, and what it is not
//!
//! The recommendation is read off the **launch method** — the command's
//! executable and the subsystem Windows records inside it — and never off the
//! entry's name. That is the difference decision 9 draws: two entries called
//! ComfyUI, one starting `run_nvidia_gpu.bat` and one starting a launcher
//! `.exe`, are different launch methods and get different answers, because the
//! Hub looked at what would actually run rather than at the word "ComfyUI".
//!
//! Everything this cannot confirm stays **unrecommended** rather than guessed
//! at: a program that cannot be resolved, a GUI executable (which may or may
//! not open a console of its own — a launcher does, a window does not), a file
//! whose header is not a PE image. Both display modes stay offered for those,
//! and the reason says so (decision 9: "未知应用保留可选择的模式，不声称已完成
//! 自动识别").
