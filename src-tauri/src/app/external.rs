//! An application the user started outside the Hub (#67, spec #59 decision 11).
//!
//! Clicking an entry whose application is *already running* must not start a
//! second copy. When the Hub started that copy itself this is
//! [`crate::session::core::SessionCore::activate`]'s business and it is
//! settled: the Hub holds the run. When the user started it by hand — from
//! Explorer, from a terminal, from another shortcut — the Hub has to *find* it,
//! and finding is a claim about evidence rather than about a name.
//!
//! ## What counts as evidence, and what does not
//!
//! Decision 11 lists three things a Hub-external instance can be recognised by:
//! a verifiable **executable target**, the **launch context**, and the
//! **process/window identity**. This module uses all three, in that order of
//! strength:
//!
//! 1. **Target.** The configuration's command is resolved the same way the
//!    display advice resolves it ([`crate::app::recommend`]), and a process
//!    counts only when the file it is running *is* that file — the full image
//!    path, or the same path appearing in its command line (which is how a
//!    batch launcher's host process names the script it is running).
//! 2. **Context.** The arguments the process was started with are compared with
//!    the ones the configuration passes. A configuration that claims arguments
//!    and a process that was started with different ones is the same program
//!    being used for something else, and that is not the entry the user clicked.
//! 3. **Identity.** A pid is not an identity: Windows hands the same number to
//!    a later process. Everything remembered about an instance carries the
//!    creation time Windows reports, and is re-checked before anything is done
//!    with it ([`crate::process::ProcessIdentity`]).
//!
//! What is deliberately **not** evidence: the file name on its own (two
//! applications are allowed to be called `python.exe`), a window title, and a
//! listening port. Those are the cheap matches decision 11 names and rules out,
//! and a candidate this module cannot confirm is reported as exactly that
//! rather than promoted to a match.
//!
//! ## Which entries this applies to
//!
//! Entries that keep the application's own window ([`DisplayMode::Window`]).
//! A Hub-hosted entry is displayed *inside* the Hub, from a process the Hub
//! started with pipes and a job object of its own; a process already running
//! outside has neither, so "associating" it would put a row on screen with
//! nothing behind it. What the user asks for when they click a window entry —
//! 唤起已有窗口 — is also only meaningful there.
//!
//! ## The three answers
//!
//! [`Outside`] has three cases and no fourth. Nothing found means the Hub
//! starts the application as it always did. One confirmed instance means the
//! Hub associates it and brings its window forward, and starts nothing. And
//! anything else — several candidates, or one it could not confirm — is
//! handed to the user to decide, because choosing between "this is the same
//! instance" and "this is a different one" is exactly the judgement a name or
//! a port cannot make for them.
