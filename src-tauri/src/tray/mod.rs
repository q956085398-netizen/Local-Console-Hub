//! Tray layer — native tray lifecycle and quick controls
//! (T09, #10; `docs/MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` §11, `docs/UI_STYLE_GUIDE.md`
//! §9).
//!
//! The Hub is meant to be a low-interruption tray-resident controller: closing
//! the main window hides it, managed sessions keep running, and the tray is the
//! way back in and the only way out (`docs/DECISIONS.md` D-006).
//!
//! ## What this layer is allowed to decide
//!
//! Nothing about lifecycle. Every control here ends in a
//! [`SessionCore`](crate::session::core::SessionCore) call — the same ones the
//! window's buttons make — and every reading here comes from Session Core's own
//! snapshots (spec §3: "Tray actions call the same Session Core APIs as the
//! main window"; "Session Core is the single source of lifecycle truth").
//!
//! What it *does* own is presentation and selection, and both are pure
//! functions with tests of their own:
//!
//! - [`model`] — what the tray shows, derived from configs and snapshots;
//! - [`menu`] — the items that reading turns into, and their ids;
//! - [`actions`] — which sessions a control is about, and what Exit costs.
//!
//! What is left in this file is the wiring those modules cannot test: creating
//! the icon, dispatching a click, and the exit sequence.
//!
//! ## Threading
//!
//! A menu click arrives on the main thread, and every control below it blocks —
//! a stop waits out its grace period, Exit waits for an answer — so the work is
//! handed to a thread of its own ([`on_worker`]). Rebuilding the menu needs no
//! such care in either direction: Tauri proxies every menu operation to the
//! main thread, and executes it inline when it is already there.
