//! Safe appends to the user's config file (#64, spec #59 decision 15).
//!
//! The config file is the user's, not the app's: they may have written
//! comments, kept their own ordering, or put entries in it the Hub does not
//! understand yet. So adding one session is a **text edit with a refusal
//! rule**, never a re-serialization — a parse-and-write-back would quietly
//! delete every comment and reformat everything else, which is exactly the
//! "有损重写" the decision forbids.
//!
//! ## What is allowed, and what is refused
//!
//! Appending is only safe when the new entry can be placed at the end of the
//! document's *last* structure. [`scan`] establishes that: the document must
//! parse, its root must be a mapping whose only key is `sessions`, and
//! `sessions` must be a block-style list (or absent, or empty) with nothing
//! root-level after it. Anything else — a second root key, a `sessions: []`
//! written inline, a document that is not a mapping — is refused with the
//! reason rather than rewritten.
//!
//! ## Why the write is checked and atomic
//!
//! A text edit computed from a stale read is how one save silently reverts
//! another. The file is therefore re-read immediately before the write and
//! compared with what this save was computed from; a difference is a refusal,
//! not a merge. The write itself goes to a sibling temporary file and is moved
//! over the target, so a failure at any point leaves the original exactly as
//! it was — the user's file is never opened for truncation.
