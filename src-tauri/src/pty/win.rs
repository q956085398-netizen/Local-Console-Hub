//! Windows PTY backend — a direct ConPTY implementation over `windows-sys`.
//!
//! One pseudoconsole per session (`CreatePseudoConsole`), two anonymous pipes
//! around it, and the shell attached at process creation through the
//! `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PSEUDOCONSOLE` attribute list — the shape of the
//! documented ConPTY session, kept in this module so the PTY layer's public
//! surface never names a raw handle. Why direct ConPTY and not portable-pty is
//! recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md` D-014.
//!
//! The conpty-facing ends of both pipes are closed as soon as the
//! pseudoconsole exists: the pseudoconsole holds what it needs, and keeping the
//! Hub's copies would hide EOF from a terminal that has ended. The Hub keeps
//! exactly the two ends a terminal host needs — the input write end (what
//! [`PtyBackend::write_input`] writes keystrokes into) and the output read end
//! (what the layer's reader thread renders from).
//!
//! ## The shell's tree, not just the shell
//!
//! The shell is created suspended and put into a job object before its first
//! instruction runs, so everything it starts is inside the tree from the start
//! (`super::super::process::tree`, `docs/DECISIONS.md` D-028). Closing the
//! terminal terminates that job — which is why the *console* is no longer what
//! a close relies on. Closing the pseudoconsole ends the console a process is
//! attached to, but a child that detached from it, or one left behind by a
//! shell that exited first, would outlive the session the user was told had
//! ended.
//!
//! Every operation here is a thin wrapper around one Win32 call, mirroring the
//! process layer's `win` backend.
