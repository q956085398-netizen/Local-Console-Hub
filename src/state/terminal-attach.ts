/**
 * One view's attachment to a session's terminal stream (T07 #8).
 *
 * This is the protocol between a terminal view and the backend, written once
 * and without React so it can be tested directly: the React hook above it only
 * decides when a view exists, and the backend below it only moves bytes.
 *
 * ## The order that matters
 *
 * The view subscribes to output *before* it asks for the attachment. Output
 * published in between is therefore never lost: those batches are held, and
 * once the attachment arrives they go through the same rule the live ones do —
 * the ones the replayed scrollback already covered are dropped, the ones past
 * its offset are rendered (`src/state/terminal-stream.ts`). Subscribing
 * afterwards would leave a window in which the session talks and nobody who
 * cares is listening, and the user would find a hole in the middle of their
 * output with nothing to explain it.
 *
 * ## What the view can and cannot do
 *
 * Keystrokes and resizes are forwarded by name; the backend refuses input for
 * a session that is not running rather than swallowing it, and remembers a
 * size for a session that has not started yet. Nothing here decides either
 * policy — it reports what comes back.
