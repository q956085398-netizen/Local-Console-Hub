   * A click on a tray row (T09 #10) is a request to *look at* a session: it

   * no tab is switched, and a session name the workspace cannot resolve falls
   * back to the derived selection exactly as a stale deep link does. That is
   * the behaviour the tray shipped with, and this listener keeps it.
   *
   * A launch request that made a terminal (#63) asks for more, because the
   * user clicked their own PowerShell entry: the new terminal has to be showing
   * and holding the keyboard, or the entry did not do what it says. That one
   * arrives as `session-opened` and goes through `showSession`.
   *
   * The read beside the listeners is what a *cold start* needs. A shortcut that
   * starts the Hub is answered while the page is still loading, so its event is
   * published to a window with no listener yet; the backend keeps the ask
   * (`take_launch_focus`) and this reads it once, **after** subscribing — so a
   * request that arrives between the two is delivered by the event, and one
   * that arrived before is found here. A request caught by both halves shows
   * the same session twice, which is what showing it once means.
   *
   * Only registered once a backend answers. A tray exists only in the desktop
   * app, and in the browser preview there is no IPC channel to listen on — the
   * same reason `useSessionRegistry` registers its own listener there and
   * nowhere else.
